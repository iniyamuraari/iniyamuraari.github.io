DRP: Designing For Real People</strong></p> <p>My favourite project of the year was building an app to address a real problem. My group chose to tackle loneliness in young adults. We had four weeks to design, develop, and test our solution. In Week 1, we defined our problem space and researched potential approaches. Weeks 2 and 3 were spent iterating through development cycles, while Week 4 was focused on preparing our final presentation and project leaflet.</p> <p>The entire process was centred around the idea of “Designing for Real People,” meaning that every decision had to be supported by real evidence from potential users. We asked as many of our friends as possible to take part in interviews, demo the app, and provide feedback! At the end of each week, we met with our two supervisors to present our progress and receive marks. I took responsibility for creating these weekly presentations, which significantly improved my presenting skills. This experience proved especially valuable during my summer internship at a consulting company, where I produced many slide decks. I enjoyed the creative freedom this project offered and am excited to apply what I learned in my future career.</p> <p><strong>2. Pintos: Operating System</strong></p> <p>In my first term, I built an operating system, which still feels weird to say. This was by far the most technically challenging project I have ever worked on. Many long days were spent debugging race conditions and keeping a lab helper close by for questions. The project taught me a great deal about resilience. There were several moments when my group felt completely stuck, yet we had to push forward to meet our deadlines.</p> <p>We completed four tasks in total. The first was an individual assignment that lasted one week. I struggled to understand it at first, and my initial approach differed from my friends’. The tests refused to pass until I adjusted my code to match theirs, at which point everything worked. The remaining three tasks were group-based, each lasting three weeks. Marks were awarded partly for passing tests and partly for a design document in which we answered specific questions. At the end of each task, we also had a code review with a supervisor, who assessed the functionality of our code and identified areas of poor design. By the end, we had become adept at avoiding “magic numbers” by defining constants and at writing consistent git commit messages. This project greatly improved my ability to work with an existing codebase and strengthened my understanding of git.</p> <p><strong>3. WACC: Compiler</strong></p> <p>My second term was all about compilers. This project felt intimidating because we started with nothing but an empty base. Although it was not as technically complex as Pintos, I found it harder to grasp the structure and design we needed to implement.</p> <p>Our first task, completed in one week, was a group DevOps assignment. We built a Continuous Delivery pipeline using GitLab CI and gained experience with other tools such as Tsuru and Docker. We later applied this knowledge to set up our own CI/CD pipeline for the remaining WACC tasks. The second task involved building the compiler’s front end, and the third focused on the back end. I struggled to keep up with the pace for these stages and contributed less than I had hoped, although my group had a strong understanding of the material.</p> <p>I particularly enjoyed the fourth task, where we implemented three extensions to our compiler. My focus was on optimising control flow analysis by simplifying or removing redundant indirect branches, eliminating dead code, and improving jump and control structures. I wrote code to generate a control flow graph and used it to ensure only useful code was included in the final output (e.g. removing the definition code for an unused function).</p> <p><strong>Reflections</strong></p> <p>All three of these group projects taught me valuable technical and collaborative skills that I will carry forward into the future. I am grateful to my teammates in each project, as the successes were the result of a team effort.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Iniya Muraari Anand.
