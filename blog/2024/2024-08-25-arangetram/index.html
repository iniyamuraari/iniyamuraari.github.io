The word “arangetram” translates to “ascending the stage,” symbolizing a dancer’s solo debut and a tradition that celebrates both the dancer’s progress and the art form itself.</p> <p><strong>The Preparation</strong></p> <p>I began rehearsing for my arangetram three years ago, with the original plan to complete it in the summer of 2023. However, with A-levels approaching fast, I decided to postpone the event to the following summer to allow myself more time to practice and really enjoy the process. This decision turned out to be a blessing because it gave me the space to focus and fully immerse myself in the preparation.</p> <p>Before starting university, I had weekly lessons with my dance teacher. Once I started my studies, though, finding a space to practice in proved difficult. I ended up using the university squash courts as my rehearsal space! It was quite a challenge, but I managed to keep up with online lessons during term time and in-person sessions whenever I visited home.</p> <p>The real preparation began last summer, during my trip to India. Scouring sari shops for the perfect costumes became an adventure in itself. Eventually, we finally found the perfect saris, and I had four beautiful costumes tailored stitched for the big day. Wearing those heavy pieces of jewelry, false hair, and layers of makeup was a painful process – but the end result was magical.</p> <p><strong>The Photoshoot</strong></p> <p>The photoshoot made the event feel real. We scheduled it around Easter to create the perfect invites and brochures for the event. The nerves set in, but the photographer was warm and encouraging, and as the session progressed, I began to relax and truly enjoy the moment. The photos turned out beautifully and became a lovely preview of what was to come.</p> <p><strong>The Reportoire</strong></p> <p>For my arangetram, I learned eight dances in total. These dances covered both Nritta (technical dance movements) and Natya (expressions and storytelling), showcasing various Hindu myths; many of which I remember fondly from my childhood. I was incredibly fortunate to have a live orchestra accompanying me. My dance teacher was on the nattuvangam (rhythmic direction), and we had artists playing the mridangam (a type of drum), flute, veena, and vocals. There’s something so special about dancing to live music – it adds an extra layer of connection between the dancer, the musicians, and the audience.</p> <p><strong>The Big Day</strong></p> <p>The day itself went by very quickly. It almost felt like it didn’t happen! My friends and family played such an important role in making sure the event ran smoothly. My sister, in particular, did a beautiful job as the compère, guiding the audience through each performance and the story behind it. My parents were the true masterminds behind the event, working tirelessly to organize everything down to the finest detail. I’m also deeply grateful to my grandparents, aunt, and cousin, who flew all the way from India just to see me perform. Their presence was heartwarming and made the day even more special.</p> <p>Each performance required a quick costume change, and my friends were there every step of the way, helping me switch costumes, reapply makeup, and adjust jewelry. While I was physically exhausted by the end of it – performing in heavy costumes with layers of jewelry is no small feat – the energy and excitement carried me through. The moment I ascended the stage and performed my first dance, all the hard work felt worth it.</p> <p><strong>Reflections</strong></p> <p>Looking back, the arangetram was more than just a performance; it was the culmination of years of learning, dedication, and the support of everyone around me. I am deeply thankful for the guidance of my teacher, who has nurtured my love for dance since the beginning, and for the encouragement of my family and friends, without whom this journey would not have been possible.</p> <p>The arangetram isn’t just an ending but a beginning – it marks the point where I’m no longer just a student but an artist ready to embrace more challenges and opportunities. While the preparation was grueling and the event itself physically demanding, it has left me with beautiful memories, and the realization that with dedication, anything is possible.</p> </body></html>
