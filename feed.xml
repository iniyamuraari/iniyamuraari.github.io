I finally performed my arangetram this summer – an event that marks the culmination of years of dedication and the beginning of my journey as a classical dancer. The word “arangetram” translates to “ascending the stage”, symbolizing a dancer’s solo debut and a tradition that celebrates both the dancer’s progress and the art form itself.</p> <p><strong>The Preparation</strong></p> <p>I began rehearsing for my arangetram three years ago, with the original plan to complete it in the summer of 2023. However, with A-levels approaching fast, I decided to postpone the event to the following summer to allow myself more time to practice and enjoy the process. This decision turned out to be a blessing because it gave me the space to focus and fully immerse myself in the preparation.</p> <p>Before starting university, I had weekly lessons with my dance teacher. Once I started my studies, though, finding a space to practice in proved difficult. I ended up using the university squash courts as my rehearsal space! It was quite a challenge, but I managed to keep up with online lessons during term time and in-person sessions whenever I visited home.</p> <p>The real preparation began last summer, during my trip to India. Scouring sari shops for the perfect costumes became an adventure in itself. Eventually, we finally found the perfect saris, and I had four beautiful costumes tailored and stitched for the big day. Wearing those heavy pieces of jewellery, false hair, and layers of makeup was a painful process – but the end result was magical.</p> <p><strong>The Photoshoot</strong></p> <p>The photoshoot made the event feel real. We scheduled it around Easter to create the perfect invites and brochures for the event. The nerves set in, but the photographer was warm and encouraging, and as the session progressed, I began to relax and truly enjoy the moment. The photos turned out beautifully and became a lovely preview of what was to come.</p> <p><strong>The Repertoire</strong></p> <p>For my arangetram, I learned eight dances in total. These dances covered both Nritta (technical dance movements) and Natya (expressions and storytelling), showcasing various Hindu myths; many of which I remember fondly from my childhood. I was incredibly fortunate to have a live orchestra accompanying me. My dance teacher was on the nattuvangam (rhythmic direction), and we had artists playing the mridangam (a type of drum), flute, veena, and vocals. There’s something so special about dancing to live music – it adds an extra layer of connection between the dancer, the musicians, and the audience.</p> <p><strong>The Big Day</strong></p> <p>The day itself went by very quickly. It almost felt like it didn’t happen! My friends and family played such an important role in making sure the event ran smoothly. My sister, in particular, did a beautiful job as the compère, guiding the audience through each performance and the story behind it. My parents were the true masterminds behind the event, working tirelessly to organize everything down to the finest detail. I’m also deeply grateful to my grandparents, aunt, and cousin, who flew from India just to see me perform. Their presence was heartwarming and made the day even more special.</p> <p>Each performance required a quick costume change, and my friends were there every step of the way, helping me switch costumes, reapply makeup, and adjust jewellery. While I was physically exhausted by the end of it – performing in heavy costumes with layers of jewellery is no small feat – the energy and excitement carried me through. The moment I ascended the stage and performed my first dance, all the hard work felt worth it.</p> <p><strong>Reflections</strong></p> <p>Looking back, the arangetram was more than just a performance; it was the culmination of years of learning, dedication, and the support of everyone around me. I am deeply thankful for the guidance of my teacher, who has nurtured my love for dance since the beginning, and for the encouragement of my family and friends, without whom this journey would not have been possible.</p> <p>The arangetram isn’t just an ending but a beginning – it marks the point where I’m no longer just a student but an artist ready to embrace more challenges and opportunities. While the preparation was gruelling and the event itself physically demanding, it has left me with beautiful memories, and the realization that with dedication, anything is possible.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="dance,"/><category term="extra-curricular"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Completing my dream]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lessons for a first year Computing student</title><link href="https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/lessons/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lessons for a first year Computing student"/><published>2024-07-02T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-02T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/lessons</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/lessons/"><![CDATA[<p>Starting university can be both exciting and overwhelming. Between coding assignments, making new friends, and just generally keeping yourself alive, university will be a challenge, but I hope my advice helps you navigate your first year.</p> <ol> <li>Start your coursework early and allocate a little bit of time every day to it. It is a lot less stressful than cramming it all the night before, and you will not understand the work as well.</li> <li>Turn up to lectures, and figure out how you best learn. I can’t just listen to lectures because I zone out, and using Notion on my laptop often means I get distracted, so handwritten notes are the best technique for me. Be aware that each lecturer works differently - if they don’t have a clear, concise set of notes you can understand, make your own (either inside the lecture or in your own time).</li> <li>Start revising early, too! Emphasise doing practice questions and past papers. Despite the learning methods being different, university is a lot like school, and the same revision techniques will work.</li> <li>Give yourself time to rest. Especially if you live in student accomodation, you will find someone going out every night.</li> <li>Don’t feel like you have to join them unless you want to - forcing yourself will only lead to a bad night out.</li> <li>Don’t feel bad if you find university hard. You have to study the same amount as high school (with less structure too), feed yourself, make friends, and join societies. As you progress, you’ll settle down into a routine and feel more comfortable. Reach out to your friends, family and university resources when you need help.</li> <li>Computer science students are well known for having no hobbies that don’t involve a screen. Break the stereotype and touch some grass once in a while.</li> <li>Stack overflow is your best friend.</li> <li>Enjoy your year. You will look back at this time fondly and wish you hadn’t taken it for granted.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="computing,"/><category term="university"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to make the most of your first year at university]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Volunteering at IC Hack</title><link href="https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/ichack/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Volunteering at IC Hack"/><published>2024-03-17T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-17T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/ichack</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/ichack/"><![CDATA[<p>IC hack - the largest student run hackathon in Europe, hosted by Imperial’s own Computing society and my first hackathon experience. Unfortunately, tickets to compete were very hard to come by, so I had to volunteer so I wouldn’t miss out on the biggest event of the year. The biggest perk of IC Hack had to be the insane sponsors. This year we had Marshall Wace, Citadel, Optiver, Terra, Jane Street, JetBrains and more!</p> <p><strong>24 hours of coding</strong></p> <p>The hackathon began with a big welcome talk at Millenium conference centre, and I was on door duty, which ended up being pretty decent as I got to talk to all the sponsors as they arrived.</p> <p>As students flocked to the common rooms, we were in charge of handing out tote bags (and stealing some for ourselves). Luckily I had a friend also volunteering, so the boring jobs like setting chairs up became more fun.</p> <p>The main sponsors got to shape the event by picking the problems teams needed to solve. This made the hackathon all the more interesting, as the problems were designed around their industry, and students could access their APIs to create to their hearts desire.</p> <p><strong>Volunteering: behind the scenes</strong></p> <p>Even though I didn’t compete, volunteering gave me a cool perspective. I got to see how everything ran behind the scenes and help the event run smoothly (and I got a special volunteer’s green t-shirt which made me feel important). Thankfully, the volunteers had a schedule so I didn’t have to work the whole 24 hours, but there were many students who stayed up working on their solutions. My friend group decided to go home and they were definitely more productive after doing so.</p> <p>The constant flow of free food was enough to draw anyone to the event. They had pizza for the volunteers, as well as food trucks for everyone, ranging from burritos to bubble tea. There were tables filled to the brim with snacks and drinks, and I may have stolen too many cans of fanta lemon to take home.</p> <p><strong>Missed talks, but got involved with judging</strong></p> <p>One downside of volunteering instead of competing was that I didn’t get a chance to attend any of the sponsor talks. I definitely plan on making time for those next year.</p> <p>On the bright side, I did get to help Terra with the judging process, which turned out to be one of the most interesting parts of the event. Terra’s challenge focused on improving army performance, asking teams to develop solutions that could enhance the performance and safety of soldiers. It was fascinating to see the range of creative solutions the teams came up with.</p> <p>The winning project was a brilliant <em>**</em>scheduler, tracker, and forecaster for military personnel, offering a way to efficiently manage resources and predict needs in real time. It was a well-deserved win, but there were plenty of other standout ideas too.</p> <p>In my opinion, the most original idea was a mapping tool designed to help soldiers find the safest routes back to base in conflict zones, which may not be the same as the fastest route, especially if the soldier is injured. It combined real-time data with historical patterns to minimise risks on the battlefield, demonstrating how technology can be used in innovative ways to save lives.</p> <p><strong>Final thoughts and reflections</strong></p> <p>As fun as it was to volunteer, it’s hard not to feel a little jealous watching teams build incredible projects, get feedback from top-tier companies, and compete for the win. The experience was unforgettable, but I will be first in line to get a ticket next year.</p> <p>If you’re into tech and haven’t been to a hackathon yet, you should definitely try to attend one, whether as a participant or volunteer. You might even end up helping to shape the future of tech— or at the very least, leave with a backpack full of snacks!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="computing,"/><category term="hackathon,"/><category term="university"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My experience at the largest student-run hackathon in europe]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First Year Ethics Project</title><link href="https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/ethics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First Year Ethics Project"/><published>2024-02-10T00:32:13+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-10T00:32:13+00:00</updated><id>https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/ethics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2024/ethics/"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of the Christmas term, we were given group coursework as part of our ethics module. We had to do it with the people in our tutorial, and they had structured it so that all the girls were in groups together (since there are way fewer of us!).</p> <p>I liked my group, but I found they were very quiet. This made collaborating a bit more difficult, especially when sharing ideas and making decisions.</p> <p><strong>Stepping up as a leader</strong></p> <p>The group had an assigned leader, but she couldn’t make it on the first day, so I volunteered to take on the role. This meant I had to delegate tasks and ensure that we stayed on track to meet our deadlines.</p> <p>One of the first steps was picking a topic from a list given to us by the lecturers. We had to choose our top five preferences for a presentation and video project. There were four topics that really sparked my interest, and luckily, my group agreed. However, we weren’t all too sure about the fifth topic we ranked—<em>“Tip jar payments feature on Twitter exposes personal information”</em>—but we included it anyway. Unfortunately, that’s the one we were assigned!</p> <p><strong>Our topic</strong></p> <p>At first glance, the topic seemed straightforward. Exposing personal information is generally regarded as unethical, so we found it more difficult to structure our presentation. However, after some research, we managed to get quite a lot of information that we could use. We had two main points to explain:</p> <ol> <li><em>Problems and Causes</em>: This section focused on the issue of personal information being exposed when people use Twitter’s Tip Jar feature. We looked at the specific causes, including poor design decisions and the lack of adequate data protection measures.</li> <li><em>Ethical and Computing Concerns</em>: Here, we tackled the moral and legal responsibilities companies have when it comes to protecting user data. We also touched on broader concerns around social media profiling and the potential misuse of personal information.</li> </ol> <p>As a group, we not only critiqued Twitter’s approach but also discussed how we would have implemented the feature differently.</p> <p><strong>Reflecting on the group work</strong></p> <p>As part of the assignment, we each had to write an individual essay summarising our research and conclusions. This gave me an opportunity to reflect on what I’d learned, both from the topic itself and from leading the group. I really enjoyed learning about ethics, but I wish we could have researched a more interesting topic; I also very quickly realised that I much prefer coding to making presentations. And, although it wasn’t always easy, stepping up and taking responsibility was a valuable experience.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="computing,"/><category term="university"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Completing my first group project]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">IBM Datathon</title><link href="https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2015/images/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="IBM Datathon"/><published>2015-05-15T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-05-15T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2015/images</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://iniyamuraari.github.io/blog/2015/images/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p> <p>We first had to submit an abstract for our project idea, but we weren’t entirely sure what direction to take. We brainstormed a few interesting ideas, but we knew it had to involve a problem that came with a large dataset so we could use the data meaningfully. One of my group members suggested creating a housing tool. It struck a chord with us because we had all experienced the struggles of finding a rental in London this summer.</p> <p>As we dug deeper into the concept, we landed on a more unique idea. Instead of building a tool to help people find houses, we decided to create a tool that allows people to choose the right area to live in within London. Our goal was to let users search for areas based on niche, personalised criteria. The idea was to include options like reducing travel time to specific postcodes, the quality of nearby restaurants and cafes, accessibility of public transport for prams or wheelchairs, school and nursery ratings, and even the percentage of the population speaking a certain language. We wanted to cater to all kinds of needs and make it easier for people to feel at home in their chosen area.</p> <p><strong>On the day</strong></p> <p>Once we had our idea in place, we started looking for datasets to make it happen. We didn’t get much done before the big project day arrived, so a lot of the work was still ahead of us. On the day itself, we spent a considerable amount of time tracking down the right datasets to cover all the criteria we wanted to include. Because of time constraints, we had to narrow down our focus and implement only a few of the original ideas. Unfortunately, the event itself wasn’t the most organized, so we ended up finding a quiet spot in the computing building and dove into the work from there.</p> <p>The best part of the day was the free pizza for lunch! It was around this time that we had finally gathered all our datasets and started coding. We took several breaks throughout the day to check in with one another and ensure we were implementing the different parts of the tool correctly. By the time most of the code was written and the presentation prepped, it was getting late, so we decided to call it a night and head home.</p> <p>After dinner, we tackled the challenge of merging all our code. Despite only having three main sections, combining everything was much more difficult than we anticipated. Thankfully, two of my group members pulled through and stayed up until 4 AM to make sure everything was finished. With the deadline looming at 10 AM, none of us wanted to stay up the full 24 hours, but their hard work made sure our project crossed the finish line.</p> <p><strong>Final submission</strong></p> <p>Our final product was a user interface with which the user could toggle different criteria for locations, and it would return a list of postcodes as well as a map showing the different areas that person would feel comfortable living in.</p> <p><strong>Reflections</strong></p> <p>It was a really enjoyable experience! As my first datathon, it differed significantly from other hackathons due to its heavy focus on data (as the name suggests). This challenge pushed me to brush up on my Python skills and collaborate effectively with a team to create something innovative and exciting.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_8044.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_8044.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_8055.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_8055.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_8057.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_8057.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMG_8069.jpg" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMG_8069.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Some pictures we took! </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="computing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[24 hours of coding]]></summary></entry></feed>
