Starting your journey as a computing student can be both exciting and overwhelming. Between coding assignments, making new friends, and just generally keeping yourself alive, university will be a challenge, but I hope my advice helps you navigate your first year.

1. Curiosity is your best friend! The world of computing is a constantly changing one, and the only way to keep up is to **embrace continuous learning**.
2. You will fail. But **failure is a part of growth**. Treat them as learning opportunities to do better next time.
3. Never feel shy about putting your hand up - there will be many people in the room with the same questions as you.
4. Don’t get overwhelmed. You not only have to manage university work, you also have to manage life. Do your best to manage your time well, but don’t forget that **life has it’s own plans**. Reach out to your friends, family and university resources when you need help.
5. Take care of yourself: everyday should involve eating 3 meals and sleeping 8 hours. Remember that working will only involve sitting at a desk and staring at a computer, so keep up with hobbies and exercise as downtime (*instead of scrolling!*).
6. When you start to apply to internships, you’ll realise the importance of networking. Your university will give you career opportunities, use them.
7. Do not compare yourself to your peers. It will only have negative effects. **Learn at your own pace**, and enjoy it.
8. I changed my mind, stack overflow is actually your best friend
9. Most importantly, **enjoy the journey**. You will look back fondly and wish you hadn’t taken it for granted.
