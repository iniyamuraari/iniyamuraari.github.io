This summer, I completed an internship with Qualrisk, an insurance consulting company. I am proud to say I have received a return offer as a full time graduate next year, and I will be working with them part time through the year.

**Joining Qualrisk**

When I first started, I had no idea what to expect from this internship. Most of my friends were joining companies as software engineer interns, and I wasn’t sure what an ‘Analyst Intern’ role entailed. My first day was eventful, as my supervisor was on holiday and everyone usually works from home on Mondays and Fridays; turning up to an empty office was scary. Luckily another colleague came in to have lunch with me, and helped me get started. Soon enough, I had met everyone in the office, and they were so lovely, I settled in straight away.

**My Work**

My role mainly consisted of research tasks; I did a major project with Qualrisk Cyber Insurance Centre (QCC), and my favourite part of this was creating a financial impact model for a recent cyber attack. I used technographic data and lots of research to find a total loss amount for the US. I created a Methodology document to show the process of my work, and finally produced a powerpoint briefing pack, which I presented to my supervisors. I also helped research and compile a few of the data products that the QCC sell, including the MGA Periscope and the US Cyber Market Report.
My minor project was with QualriskAi, and I joined them as they were selected to be a part of Lloyd’s Lab Cohort 14. This meant I helped them research and pitch the product to potential clients; a generative AI solution to claims handling. Due to the length of the internship, my initial role in coding was limited. However, since I will continue working with the team throughout the year, I have now begun to take a more direct role in the coding side.

**Working from home**

When I was thinking about jobs, I never wanted to work from home because I enjoyed interacting with people and coming into the office. While this is still true, I did not realise the flexibility working from home brings. Since mondays and fridays are always work from home days, this meant I could cook and eat my lunch in one go, do my laundry in my breaks, and shave 2 hours off a day from commuting. It also meant I could wake up and be at my desk - a fact I definitely took too much advantage of.

**Reflections**

I’m really glad I joined Qualrisk this summer; I didn’t have much knowledge on consulting and data analysis before this and it has really helped me to shape my future career. I met and worked with some lovely people, who helped guide me to learn so much.
